# ThyroCare: A Mobile Application Thyroid Disease Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

## Description

  The ThyroCare mobile application addresses major pain points users encounter when managing their thyroid health through key product features such as blood test, medication management and medicine reminder.

## Statement of the Problem

  The thyroid plays a crucial role in the body by producing and managing thyroid
hormones that regulate metabolism. A few distinct hormones produced by the thyroid,
including T4 (thyroxine, which includes four iodide atoms), and T3 (triiodothyronine,
contains three iodide atoms), regulate metabolism. Compared to men, women have a
diagnosis of thyroid disease at a rate of five to eight times higher.

  Since machine learning algorithms play a significant role in classifying thyroid
diseases, they are of great help with predicting and identifying many diseases, such as
thyroid diseases. Deploying this machine learning algorithm into a mobile application
surely helps those who are in question of their own health conditions and hopefully give
awareness of such disease.

## Objectives
  The Project Design “ThyroCare: A Mobile Application Thyroid Diseases
Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms” — aimed the following:
* Generate a thyroid disease dataset from existing data using synthetic data
generation.
* Determine the performance of each machine learning classifier model in terms
of classifying thyroid diseases.
* Incorporate a working Android mobile application that processes and analyzes
user data with the final machine learning model.

## Scope and Delimitations of the Study

  This study explores how supervised machine learning algorithms can be applied to
discover such thyroid disorders found in the body. The researchers will be collecting data
from existing data sets available and with that information the researchers will train and
create a model of the selected machine learning algorithm with the highest accuracy and
performance that will be extracted and further developed in the mobile application.

  Although thyroid diseases come with a wide range form, this study focuses
specifically on identifying the most common thyroid diseases which include
hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.
