# ThyroCare

The ThyroCare mobile application addresses major pain points users encounter when managing their thyroid health through key product features such as blood test, medication management and medicine reminder.

The Project Design “ThyroCare: A Mobile Application Thyroid Diseases
Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms” — aimed the following:
* Generate a thyroid disease dataset from existing data using synthetic data
generation.
* Determine the performance of each machine learning classifier model in terms
of classifying thyroid diseases.
* Incorporate a working Android mobile application that processes and analyzes
user data with the final machine learning model.
